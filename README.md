# About Me

I am one of the [many](https://howmany-ofme.com) people who go by the name `Dan Stace`, and this is my digital foyer, as it were.

I identify problems and inefficiencies in logical systems (e.g. software) and try to fix them.

Occasionally I have novel ideas.

Any views, opinions, ideas or other data available herein are my own.

## My Stuff

- [Kill-Steel Games LLC](http://killsteelgames.com)
  - A project I started in 2023 in an attempt to stop procrastinating and actually try to bring any of my game ideas to life, after spending many years prioritizing working on things for other people.

### WIP

- [RoverTwo](http://rovertwo.com)
  - Currently conceptualized as a generic brute-force testing mechanism for puzzle/strategy games, by way of configurable assumption-based route optimization, this idea has been living in my head in one form or another since working on [DME](CV/2006.md).

### Defunct

- [ProbablyFair](http://probablyfair.com)
  - I planned to make this into a tool for fairly picking a "winner" for highly-sought items made available via [Buy Nothing](https://buynothingproject.org), but I was not able to get API permissions I needed to efficiently collect the data needed to make it work as I envisioned.
  
- [FileSlug](http://fileslug.com)
  - Initially built for a friend as a dissemination platform for works of fiction, this eventually morphed into an idea for sharing arbitrary data in P2P fashion using physical objects. However, due to time constraints and never quite settling on an implementation pathway, the idea eventually stopped being actively pursued.
